    "Conservative electriticy prices: A grid-connected electrolyser (conservative case) pays electricity prices and 
    grid fees (~30 EUR/MWh) (United States Department of Energy, 2022). Flexible operation reduces their specific 
    electricity price below average annual electricity prices (see the subsection cost data in methods and data). 
    Progressive electricity prices: Electrolysers with a direct connection to renewable supply (progressive case) can 
    operate at low renewable electricity costs (IEA, 2023c) (with reduced full-load hours).
