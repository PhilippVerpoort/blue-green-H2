    "Conservative electriticy prices: A grid-connected electrolyser (conservative case) pays electricity prices and 
    grid fees (~30 EUR/MWh) [13]. Flexible operation reduces their specific electricity price below average annual 
    electricity prices (see the subsection cost data in methods and data). Progressive electricity prices: 
    Electrolysers with a direct connection to renewable supply (progressive case) can operate at low renewable 
    electricity costs [14] (with reduced full-load hours).
    
    CAPEX: Based on IRENA and IEA data [8,15].
    
    Share of RE in electricity mix based on own analysis.
    
    OCF either for RE-only operation mode [11] or for RE-only operation mode. Own assumption based on capacity factor 
    of wind and solar PV power [14]."
