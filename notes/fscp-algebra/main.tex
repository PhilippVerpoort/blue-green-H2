\section{Formular for switching price}

The total cost $C_X$ of a fuel $X$ is defined as
\begin{equation}
    C_X = C^0_X + \prc * e_X \punc,
\end{equation}
where $C^0_X$ is the direct cost (independent of carbon cost) in \si{\$}, $\prc$ is the carbon price in \si{\$\per\tonne_{\ce{CO2}}}, and $e_X$ are the emissions (or carbon intensity) in \si{\tonne_{\ce{CO2}}\per\kWh}. We define the $Y$-to-$X$ fuel-switching cost $\Delta C_{YX}$ (i.e.~the cost incurred in switching from fuel $Y$ to fuel $X$) as
\begin{align}
    \Delta C_{YX} &= C_X - C_Y \\
                  &= C^0_X - C^0_Y + \prc * (e_X - e_Y) \punc.
\end{align}
The $Y$-to-$X$ fuel-switching carbon price $\prYX$ (i.e.~carbon price above which it is economically incentivised to switch from fuel $Y$ to fuel $X$) is defined as
\begin{align}
                    & \Delta C_{YX} (\prc = \prYX) = 0 \punc, \\
\intertext{and hence it is}
                    &~~~ C^0_X - C^0_Y + \prYX * (e_X - e_Y) = 0 \\
  \Leftrightarrow   &~~~ \prYX = \frac{C^0_X - C^0_Y}{e_Y - e_X} \punc.
\end{align}

\section{Green-blue switching}

We now consider the fuels $X$ and $Y$ to be one of $\{g, b, r\}$, which refer to green, blue, and reference (e.g.~natural gas). In that case we have three switching prices:
\begin{align}
    \prg    &=     \frac{C^0_g - C^0_r}{e_r - e_g} \punc,\\
    \prb    &=     \frac{C^0_b - C^0_r}{e_r - e_b} \punc,\\
    \prbg   &=     \frac{C^0_g - C^0_b}{e_b - e_g} \punc.
\end{align}
We can rewrite the equations for $\prg$ and $\prb$ as
\begin{align}
    C^0_g &= C^0_r + \prg * (e_r - e_g) \quad\text{and} \\
    C^0_b &= C^0_r + \prg * (e_r - e_b) \punc,
\end{align}
and hence it is
\begin{align}
    C^0_g - C^0_b &= \prg (e_r - e_g) - \prb (e_r - e_b) \\
                  &= \prb \, e_b - \prg \, e_g + (\prg - \prb) \, e_r \punc.
\end{align}
We can substitute that back into the equation from above for $\prbg$, which yields:
\begin{align}
    \prbg &= \frac{\prb \, e_b - \prg \, e_g + (\prg - \prb) \, e_r}{e_b - e_g} \\
    &= \frac{\prb \, e_b + \prb \, e_g - \prb \, e_g - \prg \, e_g}{e_b - e_g}\\ &~~~~+ \frac{(\prg - \prb) \, e_r}{e_b - e_g} \\
    &= \prb + (\prb - \prg) \frac{e_g}{e_b-e_g} \\ &~~~~+ (\prg - \prb) \frac{e_r}{e_b-e_g} \\
    &= \prb + (\prg - \prb) \underbrace{\frac{e_r - e_g}{e_b - e_g}}_{=: \alpha} \\
    &= \prb + \alpha * (\prg - \prb) \punc.
\end{align}

\section{Possible cases}
Let us assume that green hydrogen is always cleaner than blue and that both are cleaner than the reference (e.g.~natural gas). Hence, it is $e_g < e_b < e_r$. From $e_r > e_b \Leftrightarrow e_r - e_g > e_b - e_g$ and with $e_b < e_g$ we find that $\alpha > 1$. We therefore find the follwing cases depending on the relative values of $\prg$ and $\prb$:

\vspace{.2cm}
\noindent\textbf{Case 1: $\prg > \prb$}
\begin{align}
    \prbg &~=~ \prb + \alpha * \underbrace{(\prg - \prb)}_{>\,0} \\
            & \overset{\alpha>1}{>} \prb + \prg - \prb = \prg \punc.
\end{align}
Hence: $\prbg > \prg > \prb$.

\vspace{.2cm}
\noindent\textbf{Case 2: $\prg < \prb$}
\begin{align}
    \prbg &~=~ \prb + \alpha * \underbrace{(\prg - \prb)}_{<\,0} \\
            & \overset{\alpha>1}{<} \prb + \prg - \prb = \prg \punc.
\end{align}
Hence: $\prbg < \prg < \prb$.

\vspace{.2cm}
\noindent\textbf{Case 3: $\prg = \prb$}
\begin{align}
    \prbg &~=~ \prb + \alpha * \underbrace{(\prg - \prb)}_{=\,0} = \prb\punc.
\end{align}
Hence: $\prbg = \prb = \prg$.
