annotationTexts:
  heading1: Fuel-switching points that capture the expanding competitiveness of low-carbon hydrogen with fossil applications
  heading2: Fuel-switching points that capture the inversion of competitiveness within the hydrogen supply, such that green H<sub>2</sub> becomes the most competitive option
  point1: Blue hydrogen becomes competitive with natural gas<br>due to CO<sub>2</sub> pricing or equivalent regulation
  point2: Blue hydrogen becomes competitive with natural gas<br>due to CO<sub>2</sub> pricing or equivalent regulation
  point3: Green H<sub>2</sub> becomes cheaper than blue H<sub>2</sub><br>due to high CO<sub>2</sub> pricing or equivalent regulation
  point4: Green H<sub>2</sub> becomes the cheaper mitigation option<br>irrespective of CO<sub>2</sub> prices
  point5: Direct costs of green H<sub>2</sub> fall below<br>those of blue H<sub>2</sub>
