    natural gas. The corridors illustrate the ranges for the main technology and additional sensitivity cases analysed 
    in this paper (see Table 1). See Extended Data Figure 1 for a breakdown of both costs and emissions.

    Emission intensities (x axis) and direct costs (y axis) of different hydrogen fuel options (scatter plot for 
    several years), along with FSCP estimates (contour plot) required to make hydrogen competitive with natural gas for 
    a) high natural gas prices and b) low natural gas prices. In addition to the progressive and conservative 
    technology cases, we here include a sensitivity case with very high upstream CO2 emission reductions, which 
    reflects the high ambitions of the oil and gas industry in Norway26, dotted). We use GWP100 here. For a sensitivity 
    case with GWP 20, see Extended Data Figure 4.

    A sensitivity analysis varying five key parameter to evaluate their impact on blue-to-green fuel-switching carbon 
    prices. The analysis is conducted for GWP100 and centered around low natural gas prices, progressive technology 
    assumptions. For sensitivity analyses for GWP20 and centered around high natural gas prices see Extended Data 
    figures 3 and 4. The color bar on the left side indicates how low (or high) blue-to-green FSCPs would translate 
    into a competitiveness advantage for green (or blue) hydrogen given the CO2 price range shown on the right side.
