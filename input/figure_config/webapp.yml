  desc: The hydrogen production cases shown are i) a high-emissions blue hydrogen
    based on SMR-CCS-56% technology with plant-wide CO2 capture rates of ~556 % and
    90 % at the capture step, and ii) a low-emissions blue hydrogen based on ATR-CCS
    technology with plant-wide CO2 capture rates of ~93 % and 98 % at the capture
    step. Methane emission rates along the natural gas supply chains are assumed to
    reduce from ~1 % to ~0.5 %  in 2025-2050.
