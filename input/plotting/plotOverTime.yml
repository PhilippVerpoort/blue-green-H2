  heading1: Milestones that capture the expanding competitiveness of low-carbon hydrogen with fossil applications
  heading2: Milestones that capture the inversion of competitiveness within the hydrogen supply, such that green H<sub>2</sub> becomes the most competitive option
  point1: Low-carbon hydrogen is currently not<br>competitive based solely on CO<sub>2</sub> prices
  point2: Blue hydrogen becomes competitive<br>with the fossil fuel application
  point3: Green H<sub>2</sub> becomes competitive<br>with the fossil fuel application
  point4: Green H<sub>2</sub> becomes competitive<br>with blue Green H<sub>2</sub>
  point5: FSCPs of green H<sub>2</sub> fall below<br>those of blue H<sub>2</sub>
  point6: Direct costs of green H<sub>2</sub> fall<br>below those of blue H<sub>2</sub>
